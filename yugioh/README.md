- [add your deployment link]()

## Project Description

This project uses React and a yugioh api to display the cards, filter by type of card, search for a specific card, look up real world prices of said cards, and build your own deck if you so desire.

## API

The api link below will be used in order to gather the information for yugioh cards that will be displayed in the app.

```
{data: {} }
```

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page
- Set routes
- Set search function
- Display route data

#### PostMVP

- Add styles
- Experiment with deck functionality
- switch to a nav hamburger menu
- Explore other creative means for the website

## Components

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | Display the data(cards) and use React Router to make the routes| 
| Header | Render header with yugioh pic and different routes | 
| Footer | repeat the routes at the bottom | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Displaying Cards | H | 1hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Work on Routes | H | 10hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Search function | H | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Styling | H | 4hrs| hrs | hrs |
| deck functionality | H | 6hrs| hrs | hrs |
| hamburger menu | H | 1hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Total | H | 25hrs| hrs | hrs |
